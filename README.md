# CrackIt
Password Cracking Simulator 
An interactive password cracking simulator in Python, where users can guess passwords from a provided list with various difficulty levels. The project allows users to input their own password list and choose a difficulty setting (Easy, Medium, Hard), which influences the number of attempts and the password list size. It also includes a hint system to assist users in cracking the password. This project helped me strengthen my skills in Python programming, randomization, user input handling, and basic cybersecurity concepts related to password cracking.
